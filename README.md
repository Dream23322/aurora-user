## About

## What happens during install?

The exe is going to make a folder in ur user directory (usually something like: C:\Users\4urxra\)

The folder will be called a-ac, it just has files that we need, that will be downloaded from this repositories sister repo

**__Folder Structure__**
```
a-ac/
    temp/
        demo-holder/
            -
        parsed/
            -
        processed/
            -
    model/
        aim-assist-model.h5
        scaler.pkl```

# Ideas

Non-ai checks, this would look at KD, HS%, assists, ace_rounds, 4k_rounds, damage_total,
